Utility Proposal

1. I wish it was easier to remember every team member's GitHub username for future reference.

2. A tool to store and be able to read your team's individual GH usernames would make it easier to see who is working on what specific project or task.

3. We can try to automate or simplify the process of writing things down and trying to remember multiple usernames connected to the team members.

4. Using this simple tool we can make it easier to recognize when a team member is doing outstanding work.

5. Using data storage features with Golang can be applied to this tool using stdin and stdout.
